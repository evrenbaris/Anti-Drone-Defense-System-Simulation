# Anti-Drone Defense System Simulation

This project simulates an anti-drone defense system using Python. The system tracks multiple drones entering a defense zone and neutralizes threats using a simulated laser system. The performance of the defense system is measured based on the number of drones neutralized and escaped.

## Features
- **Dynamic Drone Movement**: Drones move randomly and can reflect off boundaries.
- **Defense Zone**: A circular defense area is monitored for drone threats.
- **Threat Neutralization**:
  - Drones entering the defense zone are neutralized (eliminated).
- **Performance Metrics**:
  - Number of drones neutralized.
  - Number of drones that escaped.
  - Success and escape rates.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- numpy
- matplotlib
- IPython (for animations in Google Colab)

## How to Run
### Running Locally
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/anti-drone-defense-simulation.git
